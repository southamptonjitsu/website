## Who are Southampton Jitsu?

Founded in March 2005, Southampton Jitsu Club is the friendliest self-defence training club on the south coast. 

The club was founded by Sensei Jim Bass, and in December 2014 Sensei James Payne took over as the lead instructor. We are an official club of The Jitsu Foundation (TJF), and as such regularly attend regional and national events, from the national championships to the yearly celebratory Summer ball. There are also numerous ad-hoc social events, and our members will usually be found unwinding with a drink after sessions!

We train twice a week, all year round. All you need to do is turn up wearing tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and you will be able to start straight away! Our members are of all ages, and we welcome children from ages 10 and up. Many of our members are parents who train with their children; Jitsu is definitely an activity you can do as a family! Your first two sessions are free, to allow you to try Jitsu without any commitment to see if the art is what you want to do, and if our style and methods of teaching and training are right for you.

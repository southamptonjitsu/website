Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu is self-defence system and martial arts style based on locking, striking and throwing techniques. Jiu Jitsu is one of the oldest and best known martial art forms and our style was introduced to the UK by the late Shihan Brian Graham in the 1960s. It does not depend on strength, instead directing aggressors' force against themselves, and caters for individual or group attacks by both armed and unarmed assailants.

Our club is part of the Jiu Jitsu Foundation, a progressive martial arts organisation. We pride ourselves on acknowledging the history and practice of traditional martial arts whilst also advancing them for a modern setting and changing society.

        <p>"I first started Jitsu in December 2007. I wanted to learn self defence and also try and get
            fitter (I didn't have the diamond pattern jumpers for golf!). I was attracted to Jitsu due to
            its range of techniques such as arm locks, wrist locks, throws and ground holds. I was welcomed
            at Southampton Jitsu and find it to be a very friendly and helpful club."</p>

        <p>"When I moved to London, I randomly chose the first martial art that fitted my schedule which
            turned out to be Jitsu. I still remember going to my very first session not exactly knowing what
            to expect apart from some punches and kicks. I ended up doing scary stuff (forward and backwards
            rolls), fun stuff (inflicting pain upon others), awesome stuff (punching people) and even more
            awesome stuff (smacking people on the head with bottles). When the whole club went for a drink
            after the session, I realised that I just made my first friends in this country. What I love
            about Jitsu is the combination of the beautiful technique with the fighting. On the one hand
            getting a technique right gives you an amazing rewarding feeling, one of achievement, on the
            other hand you know that there is always so much more you can learn."</p>

## What is Jitsu?

Jiu Jitsu is a highly effective martial art in countering both armed and unarmed attacks. It is based on a moving system of striking, locking and throwing techniques. Jiu Jitsu does not depend on strength, instead it directs the aggressors' force against themselves.

Jiu Jitsu is one of the oldest and best known martial art forms, our style is called Shorinji Kan, was introduced to the UK by the late Shihan Brian Graham in the 1960's and for brevity is commonly simply called Jitsu. Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu is a great self defence system that caters for individual or group attacks by armed or un-armed assailants.

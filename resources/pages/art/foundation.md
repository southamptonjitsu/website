The Jiu Jitsu Foundation, is a progressive martial arts organisation. They acknowledge the history and practice of traditional martial arts, but place them in a modern setting for a modern changing society.

Many people come to Jitsu for self defence, others have different technical and spiritual goals. The Foundation can help you to strive to reach them, though they will all require effort, hard work and commitment.

The Foundation prides itself on being a friendly and inspiring place to train in martial arts and for having a very strong social scene at every level, from club and region to country.

Everyone who trains with us is part of the Jiu Jitsu Foundation, It is made up and run by training members and instructors, lead by the Tertiary Board. If you are a new member, welcome.

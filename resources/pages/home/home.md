Founded in March 2005 by Sensei Jim Bass, Southampton Jiu Jitsu Club is the friendliest self-defence training club on the south coast.

We train twice a week, all year round. All you need to do is turn up wearing tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and you will be able to start straight away! We are an official club of The Jiu Jitsu Foundation (TJJF) and regularly attend regional and national events, from the national championships to the yearly celebratory Summer Ball. There are also numerous social events, and our members will usually be found after sessions unwinding with a drink!

Your first two sessions are free, to allow you to try Jiu Jitsu without any commitment to see if the art, style and training regime is right for you.

This weekend the group attended the annual TJJF Summer Ball. They headed to Nottingham for a celebration of another great year of Jiu Jitsu!

Congratulations to Jim Bass on being awarded "Instructor of the year"! Thank you to all who voted for him. Also congratulations to James Payne and Tom Grange (ex SJC) for achieving their black belts. An amazing achievement and an amazing evening!

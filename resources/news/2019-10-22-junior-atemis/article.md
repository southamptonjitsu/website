Congratulations once again to Kiran and Alex who both put on a fantastic display in their competitions and came away from the Junior Atemi Nationals this weekend with a gold each!

The Atemi Nationals are at the heart of what we do. Beginners can compete in a safe and controlled environment, whilst seeing a fantastic display of skills. This year saw an incredible performance from not just the club but also the entire region.
